# Changelog

## 0.1.0

The first version, on SDK 0.26.0 and contract v22 (meridian-design
tasks/sdk-contract/an-fx-ccm-plugin-trades-spot; ruled 2026-10-13).

- `connectivity`: placements sent to OANDA's v20 order endpoint as signed
  units of the base currency. Facts come from the account's transactions:
  acknowledgements, rejections (`unsupported`, or venue rejected with OANDA's
  reject reason), fills with the date read's spot value date (a fill waits,
  never guessed, while the date read gives no answer), financing charges on
  the placement that opened the trade, cancels, replaces, pause and stop.
  An unanswered send is resolved by asking, never by sending again. The
  catalogue is published, and none is offered while the connection is
  read-only.
- `custody`: the account, its sync status, its statement (rolling spot as
  two cash legs) and its activity back to the account's opening.
- Settings: `environment` (`practice` | `live`), `token` (secret) and
  `account_id`.
- Raw records: `activity`, `responses` and `trading`, archivable.
- The synthetic OANDA serves sample data, the tests and `make e2e`.
