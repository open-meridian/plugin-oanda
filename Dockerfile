# Built on the base image for the SDK this plugin pins: Python and
# open-meridian, the same version as pyproject.toml's, already installed. So
# the image's own layer is this plugin alone, and an upload sends only that.
# Move the two together when moving to a new SDK.
#
# BASE is for building against a base made locally rather than a released one.
